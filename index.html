                    After years of chemical treatments such as relaxers, heat treatments and extensions including tape
                    extensions, microbonds and weaves,
                    my hair has been extensively
                    damaged.
                    This had forced me to really look into the health of hair and specially 3c hair. As someone who has
                    struggled with natural hair and seen that there is not that much information on 3c hair, I thought
                    it was
                    important to share what I have found out and what has helped me.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This includes the different ways you can protect your hair by using protective styles,
                    or if you are someone who prefers to wear their curls out, i have provided a hair care regiment
                    that includes how to wash the hair and products that i personally use and recommend.

                <p>
                    3C hair is a curly hair type consisting of tight coils with volume, with lots of strands packed
                    together
                    to create texture. 3C was created and added to the hair type chart when it was clear that there was
                    a
                    missing type between 3B and 4A.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In general, Type 3 curly hair is defined by having an “S” shaped curl pattern. Additionally, because
                    the
                    cuticle doesn’t lay as flat as Type 1 or Type 2 hair, the hair also isn’t as shiny.
