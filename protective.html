                <p>The point of protective styling is all about keeping your natural hair protected. This means minimising its exposure to the elements, styling it less often and generally just messing with it as little as possible.Wigs are a great protective style as they keep most if not all your hair away. They are also highly versatile allowing you to change your style day to day!

                    <br>
                    To make your wig as protective as possible, opting for a full wig with a closure or frontal is the best choice as it means all of your hair is covered whilst wearing your wig and also means less daily maintenance.
