                    <p>The point of protective styling is all about keeping your natural hair protected. This means
                        minimising its exposure to the elements, styling it less often and generally just messing with
                        it as little as possible.Wigs are a great protective style as they keep most if not all your
                        hair away. They are also highly versatile allowing you to change your style day to day!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        To make your wig as protective as possible, opting for a full wig with a closure or frontal is
                        the best choice as it means all of your hair is covered whilst wearing your wig and also means
                        less daily maintenance.

                    <h2>Twists</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>Twists are an ideal protective style with a bonus: they lock in moisture. While flat twists
                            work well on different textures, twists generally work better on completely natural hair as
                            the ends usually hold together without additional help from bands or barrettes. Twists can
                            be combined with other styles, such as flat twists, braids, and afros.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Twists, also widely referred to as two-strand twists, are a hairstyle created by twisting
                            two sections of hair around one another to the ends. Sections of hair may range from large
                            to small. They’re lightweight, add no tension on the hair and require zero heat. They also
                            last from days to weeks with the right care, so they make a great protective style.

                        <h2>Bantu Knots</h2>
                        <div>
                            <p>Bantu knots are a super cute easy protective style for natural hair. Working on all
                                lengths, from short to long, it's created by sectioning, twisting and wrapping strands,
                                so that your hair is eventually stacked in a spiral knot. Be careful not to twist too
                                tightly though, as this can cause tension and breakage.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Bantu Knots are not only protective but are also a great way to achieve heatless waves
                                or tight curls on any hair type. The smaller the knot, the tighter the curl. Large knots
                                will result in a loose wave. You can also pair the knots with another hairstyle.

                        <h2>Crochet Braids</h2>
                        <div>
                            <p>Like the name suggests, crochet braids consist of synthetic hair that's crocheted into
                                your hair. Crochet braids are a great protective styling option for naturalistas because
                                you can switch up your hair color, length, texture, and style without compromising your
                                natural curl pattern. You can still quickly get to your scalp and keep it clean when
                                you're shampooing—and, even better, crochet braids don't require heat styling, which is
                                always a win if you're trying to retain length.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Even crochet braids don't damage your hair, it's all about proper maintenance and making
                                sure your hair is healthy before it's braided down. The pros biggest tips include using
                                a gentle co-wash, hydrating your hair with a deep conditioner, and using a scalp tonic.

                            <div>
                                <p>Box braids are a protective style that can last you 4-6 weeks with proper care. It is
                                    great for the summer because your hair is fully protected. You can get braids wet,
                                    therefore you can easily wash them weekly to keep your scalp clean.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    There's a reason box braids are one of the most popular protective styles—they're
                                    easy to maintain, yes, but they're also super versatile, meaning they don't have to
                                    be boring. One way to do that? Increase the drama by parting them into bigger
                                    sections, which coincidentally also saves braiding time and keeps maintenance to a
                                    minimum.
