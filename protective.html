            <div>
                <p>The point of protective styling is all about keeping your natural hair protected. This means minimising its exposure to the elements, styling it less often and generally just messing with it as little as possible.Wigs are a great protective style as they keep most if not all your hair away. They are also highly versatile allowing you to change your style day to day!

                    <br>
                    To make your wig as protective as possible, opting for a full wig with a closure or frontal is the best choice as it means all of your hair is covered whilst wearing your wig and also means less daily maintenance.

            <h2>Twists</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Twists are an ideal protective style with a bonus: they lock in moisture. While flat twists work well on different textures, twists generally work better on completely natural hair as the ends usually hold together without additional help from bands or barrettes. Twists can be combined with other styles, such as flat twists, braids, and afros.

                    <br>
                    Twists, also widely referred to as two-strand twists, are a hairstyle created by twisting two sections of hair around one another to the ends. Sections of hair may range from large to small. They’re lightweight, add no tension on the hair and require zero heat. They also last from days to weeks with the right care, so they make a great protective style.
