# Discover3c 
<br>

# Introduction

This website was designed to help people better understand and manage 3c hair. This is a categorisation of relatively tightly curled hair that can appear in all races but in the UK is more predominant in those with BAME backgrounds.

Due to the relatively small percentage of this hair type there is a shortage of information available which this website seeks to address.This website could also have further commercial applications given there is a large market for hair care products and management regimes.

This is the first of four Milestone Projects that the developer must complete during their Full Stack Development Program at The Code Institute. The main requirements were to make a responsive and static website with minimum of three pages using primarily HTML5 and CSS3.

### Colour Scheme 
<br>

The main colours used throughout the website are Ecru, Brown and Peach with accents of Teal and Orange.
