                <h2>Steps:</h2>
            </div>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3><i class="fas fa-temperature-low"></i>Check your water temperature</h3>
                        <p>Much like skin, hot water can dry hair out. While it feels luxurious to run hot water through
                            your hair, the heat can strip your hair of essential oils. Wash with lukewarm or room
                            temperature water instead, and finish with a cool rinse.</p>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <h3><i class="fas fa-air-freshener"></i>Portion out the shampoo</h3>
                        <p>Pour shampoo into the palm of your hands and not directly onto hair. This will ensure that
                            you’re doling out the right amount and not overdoing it.
                            It’s better to start with working a smaller amount of product (about a golf-ball-size dose
                            should be sufficient) through your hair and add more if needed, than to douse your head with
                            it. Focus shampoo predominately on your scalp.</p>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <h3><i class="fas fa-user"></i>Work through your scalp</h3>
                        <p>Start by massaging the shampoo into your roots. You want most of the product to be
                            concentrated on the scalp as that’s where the majority of buildup, dirt, and oil usually
                            settles. Work the product around the scalp in a back and forth motion, not in circles—this
                            will tangle your curls and make it more difficult to comb through later.</p>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <h3><i class="fas fa-hand-sparkles" id="hand"></i>Cleanse and finger comb the hair</h3>
                        <p>Use your fingers only and not any brushes or combs to gently work the shampoo through the
                            length of your hair. Try to detangle a bit as you go. You want to start the detangling
                            process while you have product in your hair, so that even if it’s not all the way knot-free
                            before rinsing, you can at least run your fingers through larger sections.</p>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <h3><i class="fas fa-shower"></i>Massage as you rinse</h3>
                        <p>Once you’ve worked the shampoo through to the ends, it’s time to rinse. How you do this is
                            equally as important as how you applied and worked it through. Rub your hands all the way
                            from root to tip as water flows through your hair. This will ensure that all of the shampoo
                            gets out, and your hair is all clear for your conditioner. You don’t want any curly hair
                            shampoo residue to get in between your strands and the conditioner or combing creme you’ll
                            be applying next.</p>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <h3><i class="fas fa-air-freshener"></i>Follow with conditioner</h3>
                        <p>Cleansing and conditioning go together just as perfectly as any duo ever has. After washing
                            out all of your shampoo, apply your curly hair conditioner. It’s best to stick with a
                            conditioner that coordinates with your shampoo—aka one that’s part of the same curly hair
                            care system—instead of mixing and matching. Apply the formula to your hair, focusing it on
                            the mid-lengths to ends rather than your roots. Let your conditioner sit for the allotted
                            amount of time—probably between two and five minutes—then rinse it out.</p>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <h3><i class="fas fa-air-freshener"></i>Use a leave-in</h3>
                        <p>PWring excess water out of your hair to prep it for a leave-in conditioner. Pick one based on
                            what your hair needs. Do your curls need a boost of definition? Is your mane dying for more
                            moisture? Are you desperately trying to fend off frizz before your hair dries? Choose
                            wisely!</p>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <h3><i class="fas fa-fan"></i>Dry your curls</h3>
                        <p>Don’t want to leave your hair sopping wet? We get it. To soak up a little bit of the water,
                            use a soft cotton T-shirt to dry your hair. This will be more gentle than a terry cloth
                            towel. If you’re in a rush, you can break out your blow-dryer, but make sure to use heat
                            protectant.</p>

                    <br>
                    The shampoo I persoanlly use is the SheaMoisture Coconut & Hibiscus which is great for controlling
                    frizz and hydrating. It includes a blend of silk proteins and moisture-balancing coconut and neem
                    oil.
                    The gentle formula cleanses without stripping away natural oils or over-drying split ends. It is
                    also sulfrate and paraben free.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The conditioner I follow with is the SheaMoisture Raw Shea Butter which deeply moisturizes and
                    repaids damage
                    to hair and scalp while restoring shine and rebuilds elasticity. It has a lightweight feel and very
                    easy to comb through.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After washing and conditioning I apply the Cantu leave-on conditioner. This leave-in conditioner is
                    great for dry, damaged or coarse hair as it is a deep penetrating treatment made with pure shea
                    butter and other natural oils to stop and mend breakage and repair split ends.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I follow by using the Cantu twist and lock gel, which I smooth through my hair. This helps de-frizz
                    and moisituize my curls while leaving a medium to strong hold on my curls, which after drying helps
                    define and control frizz.
